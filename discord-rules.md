# House Rules
**The goal of this Discord is to create a safe space to organize around grassroots diabetes projects that the diabetes organizations are not focusing on or are not focusing on enough.**

# Summary

- This is a safe, inclusive space for people with all kinds of diabetes and allies.
- Be respectful of others.
- Consider the stakes.
- Help contribute to an organized Discord.

# Safe Space
The Discord needs to remain a safe, inclusive space above all else.

All individuals are to be treated respectfully. Do not engage in offensive remarks or behavior based on race, religion (or lack thereof), ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, political affiliation, gender, age, parental status, marital status, socioeconomic status or physical appearance. Diabetes does not discriminate and these issues affect us all (though not equally).

We are likely to have differing opinions and that is okay. Again, all individuals are to be treated respectfully. This is regardless of their opinions on the greater diabetes or U.S. healthcare ecosystem. These views include but are not limited to: thoughts on patient advocacy organizations (specific ones or in general), diets, treatments, technology, language, people with diabetes in a professional capacity, diabetes blogs and bloggers, the Affordable Care Act, or other components of the U.S. healthcare system.

Please consider what is at stake. We are engaging in grassroots actions involving pharmaceutical companies and other players in the U.S. healthcare system who wish to keep the status quo. These players have far more money, clout and outright power than we do and we should believe that they see us as a threat to their objectives. Be mindful of what is spoken within this chat and outside of this chat.

This community is not a public space but do not presume anything you say here will remain private. Act accordingly. This space operates under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule).

> *When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but
> neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that
> of any other participant, may be revealed.*

Additionally,
- Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behavior, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.
- Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of these house rules at the discretion of the administrators. 

# Housekeeping
## Channels
- New users need to be invited to the server. 
- Please try to choose a username consistent with your Twitter handle (if applicable) or name (if comfortable).
- New channels can be created by anybody in the group.
- Over time, if a channel becomes quiet, the admins of the group may archive that channel.
- When users create a channel they are the designated moderator for that channel and are responsible for it.
- Should a channel moderator have any issues, they can contact the administrators (see below).
- The Discord is not the place for self promotion of general diabetes projects or projects unrelated to diabetes.
- If the administrators determine that someone is violating these house rules, the administrators reserve the right to take action: up to and including expulsion and exclusion from this group.

## Administrators
As administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.

The following individuals are administrators of the Discord. Please get in contact with them should any issues persist:
